The ``$options`` array is passed as the ``$attrs`` parameter to the
Zend Framework `headScript <http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.view.helpers.html#zend.view.helpers.initial.headscript>`_
helper. This can be used to set some attributes on the ``<script>`` tag as
well as to enable some specific functionality of the ZF helper like IE
conditional comments.

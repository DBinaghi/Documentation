Returns a URL to a page in an Omeka site. This function can be used to create links between different pages on the site.

Plugin and theme writers should always use this helper when linking between pages. Hand-written or "bare" URLs are generally only valid for a particular Omeka installation. This helper generates relative URLs that are valid regardless of where an Omeka installation is located on a server.

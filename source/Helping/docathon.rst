Thanks to the CUNY Graduate Center, Omeka will be one of the projects tackled in the Docathon.

You can find some guides to technical aspects in the :ref:`index` guide and in the 
:doc:`Documentation <https://github.com/omeka/Documentation>` README.

Here are a couple thoughts on quick and easy ways to help Omeka documentation.

**Have you hacked or built an Omeka theme?**

You've probably had a need to modify the default use of one or more of Omeka's global
functions. (Or maybe you just had to figure out how it works!) If so, share your
example of what you did with the function so others can more of the possibilities.

You might have rearranged pages, or incorporated other libraries to get your display just right.
Those would make excellent recipes to show how your solved a particular problem -- others will
want to learn from it for similar needs.

**Have you hacked or built an Omeka plugin?**

Some of the best Omeka plugins are the smallest ones that take care of a small need. Or,
an existing plugin might have been _close_ to what you needed, but called for some modification.
Sharing what you did as a recipe is a great way to reinforce what you learned and help others
in similar situations.

**Do you just want to learn a little about coding (for Omeka)?**

No time like the present. Tinkering with existing themes to make small changes to the display
is a great way to get started. You'll learn your way around themes, see how the functions work,
learn a little more about PHP, and help your fellow Omekans!

Start with an existing theme, and try your hand at modifying the output from one of the functions. Browse through the
basic documentation for global functions, then find where they are used in an existing theme.
Then, experiment with some of the options listed in the documentation, but don't have an
example of the variety of options described. Then, share your example back for others to see
and learn from.

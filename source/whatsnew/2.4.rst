What's new in Omeka 2.4
#######################

=======================
PHP 5.2 support dropped
=======================

Keeping up with adjusted support by our various third-party libraries, the
lack of upstream support or updates, and its substantial age, Omeka 2.4 no
longer supports PHP 5.2. PHP 5.3.2 is required at a minimum.

================
REST API changes
================

The item resource's index now accepts ``tags``, ``excludeTags``,
``hasImage``, and ``range`` as GET parameters. These behave the same as
their preexisting counterparts on the regular items browse page.
